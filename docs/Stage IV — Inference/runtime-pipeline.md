# Runtime Pipeline

- [ ] Implement PERCEIVE → STABILIZE → MATCH end-to-end
- [ ] Enable MC Dropout for uncertainty in PERCEIVE
- [ ] Integrate scene–face fusion with variance-weighted averaging
- [ ] Wire stabilized outputs into k-NN music retrieval with dwell-time

## Stage details

- PERCEIVE
  - Scene model: CLIP/ViT backbone, regression heads with dropout; MC Dropout for mean/variance.
  - Face path: single-face detection (MediaPipe), face alignment, and EmoNet inference via an adapter that handles preprocessing, calibration (EmoNet→FindingEmo), and optional TTA-based uncertainty.
  - Fusion: variance-weighted averaging when both paths available; fall back to scene-only when no face.

- STABILIZE
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) over valence/arousal.
  - Uncertainty gating: if variance exceeds threshold, hold last stable values.

- MATCH
  - Query k-NN over DEAM 10s segments (50% overlap) indexed with KD-Tree.
  - Enforce minimum dwell time and recent-song avoidance.
  - Use explicit FE→DEAM static [1, 9] scaling for queries.
