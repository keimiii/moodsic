## 1. Executive Summary

Modern organizations face a critical challenge in creating environments that respond dynamically to the emotional interplay between people and spaces. Static background music fails to address the complex relationship between environmental design and human emotional states, missing opportunities to enhance experiences and drive business outcomes.

Our emotion-aware music system employs dual-pathway detection to understand both the designed intent of spaces and actual human emotional responses within them. By discriminating between environmental ambiance and genuine human emotions, the system delivers contextually appropriate music that measurably improves user experiences. The technology recognizes that identical emotional expressions require different musical interventions depending on environmental context, enabling intelligent atmospheric orchestration across diverse industry applications.

At runtime, the system still follows the perceive → stabilize → match pipeline, with uncertainty-aware fusion and temporal smoothing to ensure enterprise-grade reliability and smooth transitions.

### The Problem We're Solving

Static background music does not account for the dynamic interplay between environmental design and human emotion. Identical facial expressions can require different musical interventions depending on the surrounding context (e.g., clinical waiting room vs. luxury retail boutique), leading to mismatched ambiance and suboptimal outcomes.

Single-source emotion detection also suffers from a fundamental attribution problem: systems conflate environmental cues with genuine human emotional state. Our approach explicitly separates and fuses scene context with facial signals using inverse-variance weighting, and stabilizes outputs with uncertainty-aware temporal smoothing. This yields explainable, context-appropriate recommendations that improve user experience and business metrics.

- Inverse-variance fusion (intuitive): We trust the signal that’s more confident. Clear faces → face signal leads. Occlusions or no faces → scene signal leads. When both are confident, we blend them so neither dominates.
- Uncertainty-aware smoothing (intuitive): We smooth frame-to-frame changes. If the system is unsure, we briefly hold the last stable value instead of reacting. When confidence returns, updates resume—preventing jitter and sudden music flips.
- Example: Dramatic store lighting suggests “tense,” but customers’ faces show calm curiosity. A scene-only system picks intense tracks; ours selects gentle, sophisticated instrumentals that fit the context and keep shoppers comfortable.

### TLDR

**Why These Specific Datasets**

We use two carefully selected datasets that share a common emotional measurement system:
- **FindingEmo**: 25,000 images labeled with valence (happy vs. sad) and arousal (excited vs. calm) values
- **DEAM**: 1,802 songs with the same valence-arousal annotations

This shared measurement system enables direct emotion mapping between video and music. When video shows specific valence-arousal values, we can query music with matching emotional signatures.

**Why We Need Two Vision Models**

**The Scene Model** examines entire frames - lighting, colors, environment - providing context about overall mood. However, it can be misled by environmental factors.

**The Face Expert (EmoNet)** focuses exclusively on facial expressions, providing direct emotional signals. This grounds predictions in actual human expressions rather than just environmental cues.

Training these separately allows each model to specialize, learning distinct patterns relevant to their focus area.

**The Need for Fusion**

Neither model alone is sufficient. Scene-only can miss actual human emotion; face-only loses context and fails when faces aren't visible. **Fusion** intelligently combines both predictions using variance-weighted averaging - trusting confident predictions more than uncertain ones.

**The Runtime Pipeline: PERCEIVE → STABILIZE → MATCH**

**PERCEIVE**: Analyzes each video frame using both models, extracting valence-arousal values with uncertainty estimates through Monte Carlo Dropout (multiple predictions with slight variations).

**STABILIZE**: Applies exponential moving average (EMA) smoothing to prevent jarring jumps. When uncertainty exceeds threshold, holds previous stable values rather than updating.

**MATCH**: Uses k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search over pre-processed DEAM music segments:
- DEAM songs divided into 10-second segments with 50% overlap
- Each segment labeled with average valence-arousal values
- KD-Tree structure enables fast similarity search
- Retrieves k=20 nearest segments, selecting best match while avoiding recent repeats
- Enforces 20-30 second minimum play time before switching

## 2. Course Requirements Coverage

The system fulfills three of four course requirements through its technical implementation:

**Supervised Learning** is demonstrated through fine-tuning the scene model on the FindingEmo dataset (continuous valence/arousal regression). The face pathway (EmoNet) is used as a frozen expert in ablation studies and is not fine-tuned.

**Deep Learning** forms the core of the system through transformer-based architectures including CLIP and vision transformers, which provide robust feature extraction for emotion recognition tasks.

**Hybrid/Ensemble Methods** are implemented through the fusion of scene-based and face-based emotion predictions, combining complementary perspectives to improve accuracy and reduce context overfitting.

Update: EmoNet integration for face pathway (Aug 15, 2025)

- Decision: Replace the Phase 1 face model with the pretrained EmoNet face-affect estimator as the face expert. No face-model training is needed for the MVP.
- Preprocessing: Use single-face detection (MediaPipe) to select the primary face, then apply face alignment (face-alignment library) to match EmoNet's expected input. Resize/normalize exactly as per EmoNet demo.
- Uncertainty: Approximate with test-time augmentation (TTA; e.g., flip and small scale/crop jitter) and use the prediction variance with the existing uncertainty gating.
- Calibration (optional): Train/operate in reference space [-1, 1]; apply only if it improves holdout CCC. Default off. After face-space calibration, use the FE→DEAM mapping in MATCH.
  - Note: EmoNet is frozen. Any validation split/k-fold is for the calibration layer only; if improvements are confirmed out-of-sample, refit calibration on 100% of faces-found for deployment.
- Fusion: Keep the current inverse-variance fusion between scene and face experts. EmoNet serves as the face expert; optional student model can be added later as a distilled replacement or fallback.
- Licensing: EmoNet is CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. We will not fine-tune or modify the weights. For distribution, prefer loading checkpoints from upstream or a download script with attribution; if vendoring unmodified weights, preserve the original license and attribution and keep the project non-commercial.

POC Evaluation Plan (Ablations)

- Face-only: EmoNet on faces-found subset; report coverage (N/total, %).
- Scene-only: Scene model on full dataset.
- Fusion (late): Weighted combination on faces-found subset.
- Fusion + gating: Fallback to scene-only when no face; report on full dataset. This serves as the headline metric.
- Metrics: CCC (valence, arousal, mean), plus Pearson r and Spearman ρ for diagnostics. Always state scale conversions used.

Observed Limitations (Aug 25, 2025)

- On FindingEmo, pretrained EmoNet generalizes poorly. Face detection success ≈ 38% (7,453/19,606).
- Faces-found results (FindingEmo scale): Valence CCC ≈ 0.167, Arousal CCC ≈ 0.016 (mean ≈ 0.092). Pearson/Spearman for arousal are very low.
- Simple linear calibration (affine in reference space) does not help; best-affine holdout ceiling remains low (Valence ≈ 0.207, Arousal ≈ 0.016), indicating a domain gap not addressable by linear bias/scale fixes.
- Conclusion: Use EmoNet as a weak, coverage-limited expert for ablations; prioritize fusion + gating for the headline POC metric.

Scale Conversions (for clarity)

- FindingEmo → Reference [-1, 1]: v_ref = v_fe / 3; a_ref = (a_fe − 3) / 3.
- Reference → FindingEmo: v_fe = 3 · v_ref; a_fe = 3 · a_ref + 3.

## 3. System Architecture

Face path: EmoNet (pretrained) serves as the face expert; scene path remains CLIP/ViT fine-tuned on FindingEmo. Fusion uses inverse-variance weighting.

## 4. Phased Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0: Core Baseline (Days 1-3)

The initial phase establishes a functional system addressing the most critical requirements while maintaining simplicity. This phase focuses on scene-based emotion recognition with proper temporal handling and stability mechanisms.

#### Scene-based Emotion Regressor

The scene model leverages pre-trained CLIP or Vision Transformer architectures with minimal modifications. The implementation maintains the transfer learning approach while adding uncertainty estimation capabilities essential for stable recommendations.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
from transformers import CLIPModel, CLIPProcessor

class SceneEmotionRegressor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model_name="openai/clip-vit-base-patch32", dropout_rate=0.3):
        super().__init__()
        self.backbone = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.feature_dim = self.backbone.config.projection_dim
        
        # Freeze backbone initially
        for param in self.backbone.parameters():
            param.requires_grad = False
        
        # Regression heads with dropout for uncertainty
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout_rate)
        self.valence_head = self._create_head()
        self.arousal_head = self._create_head()
        
    def _create_head(self):
        return nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(self.feature_dim, 256),
            nn.LayerNorm(256),
            nn.ReLU(),
            self.dropout,
            nn.Linear(256, 128),
            nn.LayerNorm(128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            self.dropout,
            nn.Linear(128, 1)
        )
    
    def preprocess_batch(self, pil_images, device):
        # CLIP-normalized pixel_values expected by get_image_features
        batch = self.processor(images=pil_images, return_tensors="pt")
        return batch["pixel_values"].to(device)
    
    def forward(self, pixel_values, n_samples=1):
        if n_samples > 1:
            # MC Dropout for uncertainty estimation
            return self._mc_forward(pixel_values, n_samples)
        
        features = self.backbone.get_image_features(pixel_values)
        features = self.dropout(features)
        valence = self.valence_head(features)
        arousal = self.arousal_head(features)
        
        return valence.squeeze(), arousal.squeeze()
    
    def _mc_forward(self, pixel_values, n_samples):
        # Enable dropout during multiple stochastic forward passes
        was_training = self.training
        self.train(True)
        predictions = []
        with torch.no_grad():
            for _ in range(n_samples):
                v, a = self.forward(pixel_values, n_samples=1)
                predictions.append(torch.stack([v, a]))
        predictions = torch.stack(predictions)
        mean = predictions.mean(dim=0)
        variance = predictions.var(dim=0)
        self.train(was_training)
        return mean, variance
```

#### Segment-level DEAM Processing

The music database requires temporal segmentation to enable dynamic matching with changing emotions. Each song is divided into overlapping segments with aggregated emotion values for efficient retrieval.

```python
import time
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from collections import deque
from sklearn.neighbors import KDTree

# FE ranges (confirm in config): V in [-3, 3], A in [0, 6]
# For this academic POC: use DEAM static scale [1, 9] (per 45s excerpt). Dynamic [-10, 10] also available.

from utils.emotion_scale_aligner import EmotionScaleAligner
from utils.emotion_pipeline import EmotionPipeline

# Initialize unified scale aligner and optional domain calibration
aligner = EmotionScaleAligner()
pipeline = EmotionPipeline(enable_calibration=True)  # Load trained calibration if available

class DEAMSegmentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, deam_path, window_size=10, overlap=0.5):
        self.deam_path = deam_path
        self.window_size = window_size  # seconds
        self.overlap = overlap

            segments_df[['valence', 'arousal']].values
        )

                'valence': window_data['valence'].mean(),
                'arousal': window_data['arousal'].mean(),
            }

#### EMA with Uncertainty Gating

The stabilization module combines exponential moving average smoothing with uncertainty-based gating to prevent erratic recommendations while maintaining responsiveness to genuine emotional changes. Defaults for MVP: `alpha = 0.7`, `uncertainty_threshold (τ) = 0.4`, and `n_mc_samples = 5` in prediction. Tune only if jitter or sluggishness is observed.

```python
from collections import deque
import numpy as np

class AdaptiveStabilizer:
    def __init__(self, alpha=0.7, uncertainty_threshold=0.4, window_size=60):

        }
```

### Phase 1: Face-Aware Enhancement with EmoNet (Days 4-6)

The second phase replaces an in-house face regressor with the pretrained EmoNet model as the face expert. We detect the primary face per frame (MediaPipe), apply face alignment to match EmoNet’s expected input, and run EmoNet to obtain continuous valence/arousal. We estimate uncertainty via lightweight test-time augmentation (e.g., flip/jitter) and feed both means and variances into the existing fusion and stabilization modules.

#### Single-Face Detection and Processing

The face processing pipeline identifies and extracts the most prominent face per frame, providing a direct signal for emotion recognition that complements scene-based predictions.

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import numpy as np

class SingleFaceProcessor:
    def __init__(self, confidence_threshold=0.5):
        self.mp_face = mp.solutions.face_detection
        self.detector = self.mp_face.FaceDetection(
            min_detection_confidence=confidence_threshold
        )
        
    def extract_primary_face(self, image):
        # Convert to RGB for MediaPipe
        rgb_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        results = self.detector.process(rgb_image)
        
        if not results.detections:
            return None
        
        # Select face with highest score × area × center proximity
        best_face = self._select_best_face(results.detections, image.shape)
        
        if best_face is None:
            return None
        
        # Extract face crop with padding
        face_crop = self._extract_face_crop(image, best_face)
        return face_crop
    
    def _select_best_face(self, detections, image_shape):
        h, w = image_shape[:2]
        image_center = np.array([w/2, h/2])

#### Face-Specific Emotion Model

The face emotion model uses a lightweight architecture optimized for facial expression analysis, trained on face crops extracted from FindingEmo images.

```python
class FaceEmotionRegressor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, backbone="microsoft/resnet-18", dropout_rate=0.3):
        super().__init__()

            param.requires_grad = False
        
        # Replace classifier

```

### Phase 2: Scene-Face Fusion (Day 7)

The fusion phase combines scene and face predictions through variance-weighted averaging, leveraging the complementary strengths of both approaches.

## 5. Music Matching with Proper Scaling

The matching stage performs frame-level retrieval over DEAM segments with explicit scale alignment between FindingEmo and DEAM emotion spaces.

```python
class SegmentLevelMusicMatcher:

## 6. Training and Optimization

### 6.1 Scene Model Training (Face path uses EmoNet; no face training)

We use EmoNet as the face expert with no face dataset or training required. This section is intentionally simplified to focus on scene model training; the face path is plug-and-play via EmoNet.



### 6.2 Scene Model Fine-tuning Protocol (face path uses EmoNet; no face fine-tuning)

The training covers only the scene model. The face path uses EmoNet as a fixed pretrained expert and is not trained or fine-tuned.

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *
from fastai.callback.all import *

class PhaseTrainer:
    def __init__(self, data_path):
        self.data_path = data_path

        for scene_w in np.arange(0.3, 0.8, 0.1):
            face_w = 1 - scene_w
            
            fusion = SceneFaceFusion(scene_model, face_model, SingleFaceProcessor())

        return ccc
```

### 7.1 Performance Metrics

The evaluation framework employs carefully selected metrics for each pipeline stage, with particular attention to the risks of context overfitting and prediction instability.

#### Perceive Stage Metrics

**Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC)** serves as the primary metric, measuring both correlation and absolute agreement between predictions and ground truth. The CCC is particularly critical for evaluating whether face-based predictions improve upon scene-only baselines, indicating successful mitigation of context overfitting.

**Face Detection Rate** measures the percentage of frames where a face is successfully detected and processed, providing insight into the robustness of the face pathway across diverse video content.

**Scene-Face Divergence** quantifies the difference between scene and face predictions, where high divergence may indicate context overfitting in the scene model. This metric is calculated as the mean Euclidean distance between scene and face predictions when both are available.

#### Stabilize Stage Metrics

**Jitter Reduction Rate** compares frame-to-frame variation before and after stabilization, directly measuring the effectiveness of the EMA and uncertainty gating mechanisms. A target reduction of 40-60% indicates successful smoothing without over-dampening.

**Gating Activation Frequency** tracks how often uncertainty gating holds predictions stable, providing insight into model confidence and the effectiveness of MC Dropout uncertainty estimation.

**Response Time to Emotional Shifts** measures the delay between significant emotional changes in video content and stabilized output updates, ensuring the system maintains responsiveness despite smoothing.

#### Match Stage Metrics

**Segment-Level Emotional Distance** calculates the mean distance between query emotions and retrieved segments at each time point, providing a more granular assessment than whole-video averaging.

**Switching Frequency** measures how often the system changes music segments, where excessive switching indicates poor stability while insufficient switching suggests unresponsiveness.

**Dwell Time Distribution** analyzes how long each segment plays before switching, ensuring the minimum dwell time prevents jarring transitions while allowing appropriate variety.

### 7.2 Ablation Studies

#### Study 1: Scene-Only vs EmoNet-Enhanced Performance

This study quantifies the improvement from incorporating EmoNet by comparing Phase 0 (scene-only) against Phase 1 (scene + EmoNet face expert). The evaluation measures CCC improvement, reduction in context-dependent errors, and performance on multi-person scenes where facial grounding is critical.

#### Study 2: Impact of Uncertainty Gating

This experiment evaluates the stabilization improvements from uncertainty-based gating by comparing simple EMA against EMA with MC Dropout uncertainty gating. Metrics include jitter reduction, false positive gating events, and user experience ratings on recommendation stability.

#### Study 3: Segment-Level vs Whole-Video Retrieval

This study validates the importance of temporal granularity by comparing segment-level k-NN retrieval against whole-video averaging. The evaluation measures emotional alignment accuracy, music variety, and user preference ratings for dynamic versus static matching.

## 9. Risk Mitigation

### Addressed Risks

**Context Overfitting** is mitigated through the single-face pathway that grounds predictions in facial features, with scene-face fusion providing balanced emotion detection that leverages both facial expressions and contextual cues.

**Prediction Instability** is addressed through MC Dropout uncertainty estimation combined with adaptive gating, ensuring smooth music recommendations while maintaining responsiveness to genuine emotional changes.

**Scale Misalignment** is resolved through explicit FindingEmo to DEAM scale mapping functions, with optional domain calibration to correct systematic biases between face-based and scene-based emotion predictions.

### Contingency Plans

If face detection fails frequently, the system gracefully degrades to scene-only predictions with increased smoothing to compensate for potential context artifacts. If training time exceeds estimates, Phase 2 fusion can use fixed weights (0.6 scene, 0.4 face) instead of optimization. If MC Dropout proves computationally expensive, a simpler threshold-based gating using prediction confidence can substitute.

### 11.1 EmoNet Integration and Licensing

- Face expert: EmoNet (pretrained), integrated via an adapter that aligns inputs (face-alignment), matches EmoNet normalization, and outputs valence/arousal for fusion and stabilization.
- Calibration: Fit per-dimension affine transforms on a small FindingEmo validation split to map EmoNet outputs into FindingEmo’s V/A space; then apply FE→DEAM mapping in MATCH as defined earlier. Store calibration parameters with the model artifacts.
- Uncertainty: Use test-time augmentation (e.g., horizontal flip and minor crop/scale jitter) to obtain a prediction variance for inverse-variance fusion and uncertainty gating.
- Distribution and license:
  - EmoNet is released under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. We will not modify or fine-tune the weights for distribution.
  - Recommended practice: do not vendor weights; provide an automated download step (or load from upstream) with proper attribution and a clear non-commercial notice. If vendoring unmodified checkpoints becomes necessary for offline use, preserve the original license file and attribution and keep the repository non-commercial.

### 11.2 Files to vendor from EmoNet (unmodified)

Copy the following from https://github.com/face-analysis/emonet into `models/emonet/` in this repo. Keep directory names and filenames unchanged; do not modify the contents. Preserve the license and attribution.

- LICENSE.txt → models/emonet/LICENSE.txt
- README.md → models/emonet/README.md
- emonet/ → models/emonet/emonet/ (entire package directory)
- pretrained/ → models/emonet/pretrained/ (all files; includes 5-class and 8-class checkpoints)

Optional (for reference/testing, not required by our pipeline):
- demo.py, demo_video.py

Notes:
- We use EmoNet as an unmodified face expert under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0; no fine-tuning or weight modification will be distributed.
- If we decide not to vendor checkpoints, replace `pretrained/` with a small download script that fetches from upstream at setup time and stores under `models/emonet/pretrained/`.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a robust emotion-aware music recommendation system that addresses the critical risks of context overfitting and prediction instability through a carefully phased implementation. The system leverages transfer learning for efficiency while incorporating targeted enhancements that ensure predictions are grounded in facial expressions and temporally stable.

The phased approach enables incremental development with clear validation at each stage, allowing the team to achieve a functional baseline quickly while progressively adding sophistication. The explicit handling of scale alignment, uncertainty estimation, and segment-level retrieval ensures the system delivers meaningful music recommendations that respond appropriately to emotional changes in video content.
